My research examines the governance of the digital technologies. I study inequality in automated systems and digital platforms, and I work to help make tech more accountable and fair.


*   Professor in the [School of Law](http://law.qut.edu.au) at Queensland University of Technology

*   I lead the [Digital Social Contract](https://research.qut.edu.au/dmrc/programs/the-digital-social-contract/) research program in  QUT's [Digital Media Research Centre](http://qut.edu.au/research/dmrc/).

*   I am a Chief Investigator of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society](https://admscentre.org.au), where I co-lead the Institutions program, studying how to improve the governance of automated systems.

*   I'm a founding Member of the [Oversight Board](https://oversightboard.com), an independent organisation that hears appeals and makes binding decisions about what content Facebook and Instagram should allow or remove, based on human rights norms.
