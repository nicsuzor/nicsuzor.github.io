I research the regulation of networked society. I am a Professor at the [Law School](http://www.law.qut.edu.au) at Queensland University of Technology, and one of the leaders of QUT's [Digital Media Research Centre](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/digital-media-research-centre). I am also a Chief Investigator of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society. My research examines the governance of the internet and social networks, the regulation of automated systems, digital copyright, and knowledge commons. I'm a member of the [Oversight Board](https://oversightboard.com), an independent organisation that hears appeals and makes binding decisions about what content Facebook and Instagram should allow or remove, based on human rights norms. My recent book, [Lawless: the secret rules that govern our digital lives](https://www.amazon.com/Lawless-Secret-Rules-Govern-Digital/dp/1108740472/), is out now with Cambridge University Press.
